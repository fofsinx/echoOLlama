## 🎯 Mission
🦙 LlamaGate is an open-source alternative to OpenAI's API suite, providing a unified interface for AI capabilities using Ollama and other open-source tools. It's designed to be a drop-in replacement for OpenAI's API, making it easy to switch from cloud-based to local AI solutions.

## 🌟 Features

### Core APIs
- **Chat Completions** - Real-time chat interactions using Ollama models with streaming support
- **Audio Transcription** - High-accuracy speech-to-text using Whisper.cpp locally
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** - Natural voice synthesis powered by Opened-Ai/Speech TTS engine
- **Function Calling** - Support for structured function calls and responses

### Technical Features
- 🔄 Streaming responses (SSE)
- 🔒 Rate limiting & authentication
- 📊 Usage tracking & analytics
- 🎯 Load balancing for multiple Ollama instances
- 🧪 100% API compatibility with OpenAI
